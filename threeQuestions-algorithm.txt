1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Asks 3 questions and keeps a score, validating whether or not, then incrementing the score

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input):
-userAnswer


PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
- prompt question1
- prompt question2
- prompt question3
- label "Correct!"
- label "Incorrect, but a better answer is "


DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-correct (integer) //number of correctly-answered questions
-userAnswer (integer) //what the user answers
-correctAnswer (integer) //the correct answer of a given question
-question1 (string) //first question
-question2 (string) //second question
-question3 (string) //third question
-result (boolean) //if correct or incorrect (true or false respectively)
