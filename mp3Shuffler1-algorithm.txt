1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): To read all song titles from a text file and randomly select and output titles in a loop until the user wishes to stop

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input):
-songName (from songs.txt)

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. open song file and input songs into song list
4. allow user to choose songs generated randomly

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-label1: Play a song [Y/N]?: 

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-choice (character) the user's choice whether to continue or not
-randomSong (integer) the number generated randomly to choose the element of the song in the songs list
-nSongs (integer) the number of songs
-songName (text) name of the song
-song (list, text) list of songs with a maximum of 200

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)

10 nSongs=0
20 choice='y'
***introduction 
30 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules

40 open file "songs.txt"
50 input songName, skip to next line
60 if nSongs < 200, song at nSongs + 1 = songName
70 if nSongs>=200, skip to 90
80 if !end of file, skip to 50
90 output label1
100 input choice
110 if choice='n' or choice='N', skip to 999
120 randomSong = RNG % nSongs
130 output song at randomSong
140 if choice ='y' or choice='Y', skip to 90
999 END
