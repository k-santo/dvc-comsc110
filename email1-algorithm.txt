1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): To calculate and output the monthly cost over 30 years of a fixed loan

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input):
-anInterestRate
-amountBorrowed
-userResponse

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. ask user for the password in order to continue onto the game, allowing for a total of 3 tries
4. allow the user to input the amount borrowed and the annual interest rate
5. calculate the monthly payment over 30 years
6. output the data 

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-label1: "Amount Borrowed: $"
-label2: "Annual Interest Rate: "
-label3: "%"
-label4: "Payback period: 30 years"
-label5: "Monthly Payment: $"
-label6: Incorrect password. You have "
-label7: "tries left"
-prompt1: "Please enter the password (Author's ID Number): "
-prompt2: "Please enter the amount borrowed: "
-prompt3: "Please enter the annual interest rate: "

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-amountBorrowed (integer) the specified amount borrowed
-anInterestRate (decimal) the percent annual interest rate 
-nMonthlyPayments (integer) the number of monthly payments
-monthlyPayment (decimal) the calculated monthly payment
-monInterestRate (decimal) the decimal monthly interest rate
-isPasswordCorrect (boolean) checker for if password is correct
-userResponse (string) what user inputs for password
-correctPassword (string) correct password
-triesLeft (integer) the number of tries left
-fileName (string) the name of the output file
