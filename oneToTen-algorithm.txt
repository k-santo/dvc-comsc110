1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Will generate a random number between 1 and 10 and have the user guess the number

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
- userGuess

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. computer will randomly generate a target number  between 1 and 10
4. game loop where the user guesses with input validation and gets guess feedback or exits the game


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-user feedback: "Try again..." or "You guessed it!" in case of invalid input: "I really want a number between 1 and 10"
-prompt "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?"
DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-target (integer) number between 1 and 10 that the user is encouraged to guess
-userGuess (integer) the number the user guesses each try

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 initialize random number generator and set target to random number between 1 and 10
***introduction 
20 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
30 output prompt "What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]?"
40 input userGuess
50 if userGuess is equal 0 then skip to instruction 999
60 if userGuess < 1 or userGuess > 10 then output "I really want a number between 1 and 10"
70 if userGuess is equal to target then output "You guessed it!" else "Try again..."
80 skip to instruction 30
999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
purpose: example test case from assignment directions
input values: 5, 3, 11, 7 
expected results: " I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10.
What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]? 5
Try again...
What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]? 3
Try again...
What is your guess [1-10 or 0 to Exit]? 11
I really want a number between 1 and 10.  
What is your guess [1-10]? 7
You guessed it! "

10 target = 7
20 Objective: User will guess a number between 1 and 10.
