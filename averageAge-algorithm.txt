1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): Calculate the average age of all students in the classroom 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-numberOfPeople
-age

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. user inputs the number of people
4. a loop that inputs all age values for the number of people and adds them to the sum
5. calculate the average and output it in a statement

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-prompt "What is the age in years of one of the people in the classroom [1-122]? "
-prompt "How many people are in the classroom [>0]? "
-label "The average age (in years) of all the people in the classroom is " and averageAge

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-numberOfPeople (integer) the number of people in the classroom (0 < numberOfPeople)
-age (integer) the age of a person (in years) in the classroom (0-122)
-sum (integer) the sum of all ages of people in the classroom (in years)
-averageAge (integer) the average age of all people in the classroom (in years)
-count (integer) count of the people in for loops
3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set numberOfPeople
20 set age
30 set sum=0
40 set averageAge
***introduction 
50 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***
60 prompt "How many people are in the classroom [>0]? "
70 user inputs numberOfPeople
80 set count=0, until count<numberOfPeople, count+1, repeat the following:
90 prompt "What is the age in years of one of the people in the classroom [1-122]? "
100 user inputs age
110 set sum = sum + age, end loop
120 set averageAge= sum/numberOfPeople
130 output label "The average age (in years) of all the people in the classroom is " and averageAge

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
purpose: normal, tested values
inputs: 4, 25, 37, 19, 50
expected results: The average age (in years) of all the people in the classroom is 33
