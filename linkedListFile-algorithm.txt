1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do):to calculate the average, lowest, highest, and scores above average of a list of scores 

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input):
-score

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. read scores from file, input into list
4. calculate the average, highest, and lowest scores


OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-label1 "Number of scores:"
-label2 "Average: " 
-label3 "Highest score:" 
-label4 "Lowest score:"
-label5 "number of scores above average:"

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-low (integer) lowest score
-high (integer) highest score
-average (decimal) average of all scores
-nGreater (integer) number of scores above average
-totalScores (integers) sum of all scores
-count (integer) number of scores
-scoreList (linked list) list of scores
-i (integer) loop index
-score (integer) score used to manipulate scoreList
3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
