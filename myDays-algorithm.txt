1. Objective (1 sentence brief description of what this will do): To calculate how old the programmer will be by the due date of the assignment

2. Requirements (any and all requirements organized by input, processing, output, data):
INPUT (any data items to be input): 
-programmer's input
-yearsLived (integer) total number of years in between DOB and the due date (including birthyear and current year)
-leapYears (integer) number of leap years in between the DOB and the due date
-nDaysBeforeBirth (integer) total number of days before the DOB, including the DOB
-dDaysRemaining (integer) total number of days after the due date, excluding the due date

PROCESSING (list of significant parts of the objective that will become the list of code blocks in program):
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. input yearsLibed, nLeapYears, nDaysBY, nDaysRemaining
4. calculate how many days old you will be by the due date of this assignment
5. output the DOB, due date, and the number of days inbetween the dates

OUTPUT (list of anything output: introduction, data items, labels, prompts) : 
-user introduction: introduction of objective, author, user instructions/rules
-Label: "DOB: " and dob
-Label: "Due Date: " and dueDate
-Label: "Age: " and days

DATA (list of all data items: definition, data type, formatting, or any other specifications):
-yearsLived (integer) total number of years in between DOB and the due date (including birthyear and current year)
-leapYears (integer) number of leap years in between the DOB and the due date
-nDaysBeforeBirth (integer) total number of days before the DOB, including the DOB
-dDaysRemaining (integer) total number of days after the due date, excluding the due date
-days (integer) how many days old you will be by the due date of the assignment
-dob (text) person's date of birth [month, day, year]
-dueDate (text) due date of the assignment [month, day, year]

3. Algorithm instructions (recipe)
***data
10 set days = 0
20 set dob = "September 9, 2005"
30 set dueDate = "February 13, 2020"
***introduction 
40 output introduction: objective, author, instructions/rules
***input 
50 set yearsLived = 16
60 set leapYears = 4
70 set nDaysBeforeBirth = 252
80 set nDaysRemaining = 322
***calculate how many days
90 set days = 365 * yearsLived
100 set days = days + leapYears
110 set days = days - nDaysBeforeBirth
120 set days = days - nDaysRemaining
130 output DOB, dueDate, and days

999 END

4. Test cases (list purpose of each test case, any input values, and expected results)

Test case #1: 
purpose: to test normal input values, which there are only one of
Input: yearsLived = 21
       leapYears = 5
       nDaysBeforeBirth = 151
       nDaysRemaining = 102
intended output: DOB: September 9, 2005
                 Due Date: February 13, 2020
                 Days: 5270

***data
10 days = 0
20 dob = "September 9, 2005"
